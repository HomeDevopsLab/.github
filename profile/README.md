# Home DevOps Lab

The Home DevOps Lab project aims to popularize the concept of Homelab on the internet. Why is it worth getting interested in?

## 📚 Knowledge Acquisition
I believe that acquiring knowledge through practice is one of the most effective ways of learning. A homelab environment allows you to conduct various experiments with the latest technologies while avoiding the high costs of public clouds.

This way, you can learn many technologies useful in the cloud such as:
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Automation (CI/CD)
* Monitoring

## 🧪 Testing Environment
Having your own infrastructure allows you to safely test professionally developed solutions.

## 🏠 Self-hosting
Using cloud space costs money. Even if it's just photos on Google. Providers of such solutions change the terms of their services from time to time - unfortunately, usually to the disadvantage of their users. Thanks to home infrastructure, we can change our mind at any time and move our resources to our own equipment.
